Here’s a comprehensive list of common hints and errors you might encounter on LeetCode:

1. **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE):**
   - Your solution took too long to run. You need to optimize your algorithm, either by improving the time complexity or by optimizing certain parts of the code.
2. **Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE):**
   - Your solution uses more memory than allowed. This typically means you need to reduce the space complexity of your solution.
3. **Wrong Answer (WA):**
   - Your code produced an output, but it was not correct for one or more test cases. Review your logic, and test your solution with different cases.
4. **Output Limit Exceeded:**
   - Your solution’s output is too large. This often happens if you’re printing too much data, such as unnecessary debugging information.
5. **Runtime Error (RE):**
   - Your code threw an exception or crashed during execution. Common causes include dividing by zero, accessing out-of-bounds array indices, or using a null pointer.
6. **Compilation Error:**
   - Your code did not compile successfully due to syntax errors, missing libraries, or incompatible code constructs.
7. **Accepted (AC):**
   - Your solution was correct and met all the time and space constraints for all test cases.
8. **Partially Accepted:**
   - Your solution passed some of the test cases but failed others. This usually happens in problems with multiple subtasks or when partial points are awarded for solving part of the problem.
9. **Output is not the same as expected output:**
   - This means your solution’s output format is incorrect or it doesn’t match exactly what the problem statement expects. Make sure to follow the output format strictly.
10. **Invalid Return Value:**

- Your function returned a value that was not expected. Ensure that your return type and value match what the problem requires.

1. **Segmentation Fault:**

- This is a specific type of runtime error where your program tries to access restricted memory. This often happens with incorrect pointer operations in languages like C++.

1. **Stack Overflow:**

- Your solution used too much stack memory, typically due to deep or infinite recursion. Consider converting recursive solutions to iterative ones or optimizing your recursion.

1. **Heap Overflow:**

- Your program used more heap memory than allowed, often due to excessive dynamic memory allocation. Optimizing space usage can help.

Creating a demo C++ program that triggers all the common LeetCode hints and errors is an interesting challenge. I'll provide a sample code snippet for each hint/error. You can run these snippets individually to see the corresponding hint/error.

### 1. **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)**

This happens when the algorithm is not efficient enough.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    while (true) {
        // Infinite loop to trigger TLE
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. **Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE)**

This occurs when the program uses more memory than allowed.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n = 1e9; // Allocating a large array
    int* arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }
    cout << arr[0] << endl;
    delete[] arr;
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. **Wrong Answer (WA)**

This happens when the output is incorrect for the test case.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << a + b + 1 << endl; // Incorrectly adding 1
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. **Output Limit Exceeded**

This occurs when the program produces too much output.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
        cout << "Outputting too much!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Runtime Error (RE)**

This occurs due to a crash, such as division by zero or accessing an invalid memory location.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 0;
    cout << 1 / x << endl; // Division by zero
    return 0;
}
```

### 6. **Compilation Error**

This occurs when there are syntax errors or incorrect code constructs.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << // Missing semicolon and closing quote
    return 0;
}
```

### 7. **Accepted (AC)**

This happens when the program is correct and efficient.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << a + b << endl; // Correct output
    return 0;
}
```

### 8. **Partially Accepted**

This happens when a solution works for some test cases but fails others.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 1) {
        cout << a + b << endl; // Works only when a == 1
    } else {
        cout << a - b << endl; // Incorrect logic for other cases
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 9. **Output is not the same as expected output**

This happens when the output format is incorrect.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << "Sum is: " << a + b << endl; // Extra text
    return 0;
}
```

### 10. **Invalid Return Value**

This happens when the return value is not as expected.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int someFunction() {
    return 0; // Function is expected to return a string or another type
}

int main() {
    someFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

### 11. **Segmentation Fault**

This occurs due to invalid memory access.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    cout << *ptr << endl; // Dereferencing a null pointer
    return 0;
}
```

### 12. **Stack Overflow**

This occurs due to deep or infinite recursion.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void recursiveFunction() {
    recursiveFunction(); // Infinite recursion
}

int main() {
    recursiveFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

### 13. **Heap Overflow**

This happens when more heap memory is used than allowed.

```
cppCopy code#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    while (true) {
        int* ptr = new int[1000000]; // Keep allocating memory
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```
cppCopy codeclass Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1e9; ++i) {

        return largeVector; // Returning a large vector to trigger MLE
    }
};
```

### 3. **Wrong Answer (WA)**

```
cppCopy codeclass Solution {

            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (hashMap.find(complement) != hashMap.end()) {
                return {hashMap[complement], i};

```

### 9. **Output is not the same as expected output**

```
cppCopy codeclass Solution {
public:

```

Each of these code snippets is designed to trigger the specific error or hint in the context of the `twoSum` problem using the given template. You can run these in a LeetCode-like environment to see how they behave.
